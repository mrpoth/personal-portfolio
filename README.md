# Adam Pothitos' Personal Site

I wanted to make a personal site from scratch, both for learning purposes and to showcase some of the skills I've learnt since starting web development. 

The goal was to make a website that was easily updated so I decided to use a static site generator and integrate it with Netlify so that it could support continuous deployment.

## Tech used:

- HTML5
- SASS

## Tools used:
