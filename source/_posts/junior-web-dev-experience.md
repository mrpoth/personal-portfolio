After graduating from university with a psychology degree, becoming a professional web developer was not what I had in mind for myself.

Of course, throughout university, I had worked as a freelancer for online tech publications, which meant I was always on top of the industry and had a keen interest in pretty much anything tech-related.

When I first started working at Add People, my job was as sort of a jack-of-all-trades. I wrote content for internal and external purposes, helped out with tech support, and did simple WordPress jobs.

Eventually, it was obvious that another junior developer was needed so I dug in and started learning as much as I can while requesting to work on simple tickets on Jira.

Thankfully, the company gave me the opportunity to learn at my own pace and soon enough I was working on more and more complex tickets, under the guidance of the other junior developer and another senior dev.

My official Junior Web Developer title came in January 2019 though I had started working on various tickets and projects before that.

Since then, I have worked with WordPress, some Magento (which I did/do not like at all), bespoke websites, and a lot more.

I've now got experience with building HTML/CSS/JS sites from scratch, working with Laravel and Vue, building a back-end with NodeJS/Express, and working with various databases including MySQL and MongoDB.

So far, the journey has been very enjoyable but also incredibly difficult. It's easy to feel lost at times, especially when starting a new project.

My first advice is to stop, think, and compartmentalize.

For example, when I decided to build an app that would show you a random top-rated film (so I can get movie suggestions for my girlfriend and I), I thought it was going to be a very easy task.

But when you get into it, you want to use new tech, different platforms, and to keep on adding features until you go crazy.

The final product (<a href="http://moviesroulette.com" target="_blank">MoviesRoulette</a>) uses Vue, Node/Express, and MongoDB while being hosted on Amazon's EC2. To get there, however, I used so many different tools and platforms that I got frustrated constantly.

The other, perhaps more important advice, is to find a mentor. I am lucky enough to have a friend that always helps when I have a question and guides me through the bullshit, something which has been incredibly helpful in my learning and growing as a developer.

As long as you are ready to dig in, and accept the fact that you are going to fail a lot before you create something good, then I think that developing for the web can be very rewarding indeed.
